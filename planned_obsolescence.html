        <h1>A Light Goes On</h1>

            <h2 style="font-weight: lighter;"><i>So spoke the Phoebus Cartel: "Let them all burn out."*</i></h2>

                <p>It all began with the incandescent lightbulb.</p>

                <p>In 1924, the lifetime of the average household lightbulb could reach 2,500 hours. That’s over 104 days of burn time per bulb, and only then if the lightbulb was in use for a full twenty-four hours every day. For the consumer, this was a fantastic situation. Most lightbulbs would only need to be replaced twice a year, and many only once over that period – that is, if they needed replacement at all. In some extreme cases, incandescent lightbulbs wouldn’t need to be replaced for decades. (The <a href="https://www.livermoreca.gov/things-to-do/centennial-light-bulb">Centennial Light Bulb</a>, for example, was first turned on in 1901 and is still in use today.)</p>

                <p>For the manufacturers, however, this longevity posed a problem. How were they to maintain a consistent profit from a product that so rarely needed to be replaced?</p>

                <p>Enter the Phoebus cartel.</p>

                <p>Formed on December 23, 1924 by a number of concerned parties – namely, an international coalition of major lightbulb manufacturers – the cartel sought to solve the issue of the incandescent lightbulb. Ultimately, they agreed on a very simple solution: they needed to make their product worse. This resulted in a 1925 code decreeing that none of the lightbulbs produced by any of the hundreds of factories bound by the cartel’s agreement were permitted to create lightbulbs with a burn time exceeding 1000 hours.</p>

                <p>Yet despite its simplicity, bringing their decision to life was easier said than done. To start with, it took a considerable amount of engineering to reduce the efficacy of the lightbulb so that the product would burn out consistently at 1000 hours. An unreliable, inferior product was not sufficient for the cartel’s purposes; rather, they needed a design that could be trusted to meet their new standard. Additionally, it required implementation of fines, as well as additional policies to ensure compliance from the cartel’s members. Bulbs were regularly reviewed by a factory in Switzerland to ensure they met the regulated standard of burning time; those that failed to meet or exceeded that standard engendered fines. When attempts at increasing the voltage of bulbs to restore their longer lives was discovered by the cartel, members found their efforts quashed by new regulations designed to keep the voltage down – and conversely ensured that the organization’s profits remained high.</p>

                <p>Due to both dropping manufacturing costs and the re-engineering of its lifespan, the lightbulb became cheaper to make and sold increasingly well. Instead of responding to the demand by lowering the price, the cartel left it consistent and instead took advantage of these factors to rake in the profit that the original predicament had left its members so hungry for.</p>

                <p>World War II forced the Phoebus cartel to dissolve in 1940 conflict left international collusion an impossibility, but its legacy remains: the same chain of events that led the incandescent lightbulb to profitability also gave birth to planned obsolescence, the formal strategy of designing products to become unusable after a certain period of time so that the consumer is forced to replace it – or, in many cases, is manipulated into feeling compelled to purchase an upgrade, whether real or perceived.</p>

                <p>Planned obsolescence took root in the United States and has spent decades blooming throughout its capitalist spheres. The automobile industry began releasing cars with the same old engineering but a brand new look each year, and advertised their products as indicative of social status. Fast fashion broke out and began releasing cheap clothing, often produced unethically, for a price low enough to draw in consumers that leave profit margins high enough to line their pockets, and then some. Tech companies utilize proprietary software and hardware to force consumers to rely on them for repairs; crippleware and advertising to make their old products defunct and trick their consumers into wanting the newer models. But no matter the method, planned obsolescence benefits businesses alone with little to no regard for consumers outside of what’s in their wallets.</p>

                <p>*<i>As far as I know, nobody in the Phoebus cartel said this; I'm just being dramatic.</i></p>
